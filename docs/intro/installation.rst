Installing PProgess
====================

Installing with pip (Recommended)
----------------------------------

The easiest (and recommended) way to install PProgress is using pip (Pypi). The
verison on pip reflects the latest production (stable) version of the code. To
install PProgress from pip, simply type:

    pip install pprogress

In your console. It should install rather quickly as the package is quite small.


Installing from Source
-----------------------

If you would like to install the code from source (particularly for development
purposes) you can clone the project on Github_.

.. _Github: https://github.com/fhorrobin/PProgress

Once you have cloned the project, you can either use the code locally or install
the code on your system. To use the code locally, simply place the folder
`pprogress` from the repository inside the folder for your project.

To install from source, open the folder cloned from the repository in your
console and type:

    python setup.py
